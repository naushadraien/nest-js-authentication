  ├── app.module.ts       # Root module of the application
  ├── main.ts             # Entry point for the application
  ├── common/             # Shared utilities, guards, pipes, and interceptors
  ├── modules/            # Feature-specific modules
  ├── services/           # Business logic and service files
  └── controllers/        # Controllers handling API requests
  ```

  ## Dependencies

  - Node.js (v16 or later)
  - NestJS (v9.x)
  - TypeScript (v4.x)
  - Other dependencies are listed in the package.json file for each project.

  ## Configuration

  This project uses environment variables for configuration. The following variables should be defined in a .env file:

  - PORT: The port number to run the server (default: 3000).
  - DATABASE_URL: Connection string for the database.
  - JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT authentication.

  ## Examples

  The following examples are included in the repository:

  - Hello World API: A simple controller and service setup.
  - CRUD Operations: Implementing CRUD operations with a database.
  - Authentication: JWT-based authentication and authorization.

  Run the examples by switching to the respective branches or exploring the lessons folder.

  ## Troubleshooting

  - Issue: Application fails to start.
    - Solution: Check for missing or misconfigured environment variables.
  - Issue: Database connection errors.
    - Solution: Verify that the DATABASE_URL in the .env file is correctly set.

  For additional help, raise an issue in the repository.
